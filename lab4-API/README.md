[CodePen Weather + ISS App](https://codepen.io/RubenPieters/pen/MxzGdr?editors=1010)

### Instructions

This weather app lets you see the current weather on your location. It also adds an extra feature to see your upcoming ISS pass times on the same location.
The app will see if the current weather is too cloudy to possible see the ISS fly by and will let you know the next pass time.
If the weather is ideal then it will only show the upcoming pass time.

Accept the location pop-up in your browser to start.
The current weather should be displayed, aswell as your upcoming ISS pass time.

Weather is clear at the moment but want to see the second upcoming pass time? Check the Javascript file for extra info. (line 40)
