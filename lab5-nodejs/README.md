These are the files for the new lab, lab5 NodeJS Basics. In this lab we saw how to set up an API in addition with the Express generator. 
The different kind of routes in the app are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
All the routes are working on my localhost AND on Postman AND on my deployed app on Heroku. 
~~For some reason, that I have not found yet, is it not working on the API checker on CodePen.
So I recommend checking [this link](https://webtech3.herokuapp.com/api/v1/messages) to see that it works.~~

~~I'll be putting the same link and explanation on my [CodePen link](https://codepen.io/RubenPieters/pen/wZKwmG?editors=1011)~~

All bugs are now fixed and the app is up and running on Heroku and can be confirmed on the CodePen API checker. Links below
